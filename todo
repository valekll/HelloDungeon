CombatStage
	- Level up should be allowed in the middle of a CombatStage. i.e. lvl+ and then show stat increases in post game screen like 
	pokemon.
	- Stage Presence based on Speed i.e. 40 Speed gives you 40 Stage Presence, if you have an Attack that consumes 25 
	Stage Presence and an Attack that consumes 10 SP, but not an attack that consumes only 5 or less SP, then you pass the turn 
	and get an additional 40(Speed) + (5(Leftover SP) - SP Subtractor Modifier) the next turn.

modify speed stat across the board to want a base of 40, etc.
